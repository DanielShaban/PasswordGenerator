        Hey ðŸ‘‹ {'\n'}
        My name is Daniel Shaban. I'm a React Native Developer Looking for a job
        in Canada.{'\n'}
        You can reach me here: {'\n'}

        {'\n'}I came up with the idea of this application after my password got
        into the leaked password databases for the third time and it became
        unsafe to use it. I had to change it everywhere... With this
        application, I can always generate my password and remember only 1 key.{' '}
        {'\n'}
        This app doesnâ€™t have a server-side. That means I donâ€™t collect
        passwords that you generate.

        {'\n'}
        If you like my app and want to help me, you can refer me to help me get
        hired as frontend developer (React/Raect Native) or as a Back-end
        developer (Node.js, express)
